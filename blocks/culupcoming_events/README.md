CUL Upcoming Events block
=========================
The block displays the displays future events in a summarized list. The number of days in advance is a setting.

Events are generated directly from the calendar and/or activity deadlines, providing a link to full details or
directly to the activity.

There are also links to Go to calendar... and add a New Event....

The block is based on the core Moodle Upcoming Events Block but is styled like a feed to match the CUL Activity Feed
Block.

The block refreshes every 5 mins if a page is left idle. Events are added dynamic when scrolling.
