Feature: CUL Upcoming events block scroll
  In order to be kept informed
  As a user
  I can scroll the CUL Upcoming events block to view more events

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
        | username | firstname | lastname | email |
        | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@example.com |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I create a calendar event with form data:
        | id_eventtype | Site |
        | id_name | My Site Event |
        | id_repeat | 1 |
        | id_repeats | 10 |
    And I navigate to "Appearance > Default Dashboard page" in site administration
    And I press "Blocks editing on"
    And I add the CUL Upcoming Events block
    And I press "Reset Dashboard for all users"
    And I log out

  Scenario: Scrolling loads more events
    Given I log in as "student1"
    # Confirm the feed is showing only 7 events.
    Then I should see "7" events in feed
    # Confirm that scrolling adds remaining events
    And I scroll the events feed
    Then I should see "10" events in feed
    And I should see "No more events"
