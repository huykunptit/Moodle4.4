Feature: CUL Upcoming events look ahead
  In order to be kept informed
  As an admin or teacher
  I can limit how far ahead the the events are shown

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
        | fullname | shortname | category | groupmode |
        | Course 1 | C1 | 0 | 1 |
    And the following "users" exist:
        | username | firstname | lastname | email |
        | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@example.com |
        | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
        | user | course | role |
        | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
        | student1 | C1 | student |
    And the following config values are set as admin:
        | lookahead | 15 | block_culupcoming_events |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Appearance > Default Dashboard page" in site administration
    And I press "Blocks editing on"
    And I add the CUL Upcoming Events block
    And I press "Reset Dashboard for all users"
    And I log out

  Scenario: Lookahead can be set at block level
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add the "Calendar" block
    And I create a calendar event with form data:
        | id_eventtype | Course |
        | id_name | My Course Event |
        | id_repeat | 1 |
        | id_repeats | 10 |
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I add the CUL Upcoming Events block
    And I configure the "block_culupcoming_events" block
    And I set the field "Number of days in the future to look for upcoming events" to "365"
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I log out
    Given I log in as "student1"
    # Confirm the feed is showing only 3 events.
    Then I should see "3" events in feed
    And I should see "No more events"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    Then I should see "7" events in feed
    # Confirm that scrolling adds remaining events
    And I scroll the events feed
    Then I should see "10" events in feed
    And I should see "No more events"
